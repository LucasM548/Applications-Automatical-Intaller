## üîΩ Installation

Run the `install_python_and_packages` BAT file, then you need to restart it to be able to install the packages (unless Python was already installed).

## ü§î Explications

This repository allows automatic installation of applications selected from a list (which can be easily expanded). Each installation of each application will be carried out and launched in administrator mode (to avoid any conflicts), and they will be stored in the Windows 'Downloads' folder. Please note, however, that some applications like "Nvidia App" or "Davinci Resolve" do not work (because they require connections during installation or otherwise). Once checked, they will lead to the website where you can install them. All applications presenting this problem are marked with ‚Äú(Manual)‚Äù in their name and will be in Purple, in addition you will be able to find a list of extensions which will also lead to their site.
